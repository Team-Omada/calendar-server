# server

Our entry point for the server is index.js. Our server currently runs on port 3000, go to localhost:3000 in your browser to see the "Hello World" message.

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Runs server in dev mode with hot-reload

```
npm run dev
```

### Runs without hot-reload

```
npm run start
```

### Testing database queries

To connect to the database and write some queries, download [MySQLWorkbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) and enter the info on CC. Depending on the default settings you may need to go to the SSL tab and set the "Use SSL" option to "No". Otherwise you may get an error.

### VSCode Extensions

I would recommend downloading the ESLint and Prettier extensions to keep coding styles consistent!

### Commit conventions

Just to organize our commits a bit, we could just use the "feat", "fix", "chore" convention from this [guide](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
